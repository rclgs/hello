# `hello`

## Overview

This is my personal playground for experimenting with and learning various programming languages and development frameworks. Each project provides a hands-on opportunity to explore new technologies and concepts. While the repository name is a nod to the classic "Hello, World" tradition, the content reflects my journey of discovery and growth in the software development field.

## Project Structure

I envision the repository to follow a structured format for easy navigation, like so:

```
hello/
│
├── javascript/
│   ├── react/
│   ├── node/
│   └── vue/
│
├── python/
│   ├── django/
│   ├── flask/
│   └── fastapi/
│
└── README.md
```
